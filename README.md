# ImageModifier_DUT

Unix friendly, couldn't find the correct way to build on Windows.

This project uses the libjpeg library for reading and writing jpeg pictures.
The rest allows you to read modify and write simple PPM, PGM and TGA pictures.

You can use the makefile with the libjpeg include and lib path to compile the project, or adapt the XCode project file for MacOs if you'd like.
This is primarily aimed for experimenting with pictures' simple modifications.

Some code for testing purposes has been left for you to understand how to use the source code.

Have fun !
